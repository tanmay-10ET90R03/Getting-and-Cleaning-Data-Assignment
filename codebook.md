-This codebook is for the Tidy.txt dataset. 

-This Tidy.txt is basically a text file which contains space-separated values. 

-The first row of the dataset contains the names of the variables and the onward rows contain the values of the corresponding variables.

-In each row, for a specific subject and activity there are different signal measurements.


-subject: an integer type identifier, varies from 1 to 30.

-activity: a string type identifier, represents the activity states of the subject. Values can be anyone from Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying.

-Time_: represents time domain signals, used in capturing accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

The time domain signals are magnitude, mean and standard deviation of body acceleration, gravity acceleration, body acceleration jerk, angular velocity, angular velocity jerk. All these time domain signals are represented in X, Y and Z direction. 

The frequency domain signals are also same for the above mentioned components in X, Y and Z direction.  

-Frequency_: represents time domain signals, used in application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.
